You will need to create a folder named "iGO" in the root directory of your device's internal storage or external SD card, and copy the files there. The folder structure should look like this:

    âââ iGO_Primo_9.6.29.483387.apk
    âââ data.zip

        â   âââ ...
        âââ ...

Note that the names of the files may vary depending on the source and version you downloaded.
 
## Step 3: Install and run the app
 
After copying the files, you will need to install and run the app on your device. To do this, you will need to enable the installation of apps from unknown sources in your device's settings. You can find this option under Security or Applications settings. Then, you can use any file manager app to locate and tap on the iGO\_Primo\_9.6.29.483387.apk file
