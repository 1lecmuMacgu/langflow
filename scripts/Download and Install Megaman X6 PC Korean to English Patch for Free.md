# How to Play Mega Man X6 PC in English
 
Mega Man X6 is a classic action platformer game that was released for the PlayStation in 2001. However, not many people know that there was also a PC version of the game, but it was only released in Korea. This means that the game is entirely in Korean, which can be a problem for fans who want to play it on their computers.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to play Mega Man X6 PC in English, thanks to some dedicated fans who have been working on a translation patch. In this article, we will show you how to download and install the patch, and enjoy the game in English.

The patch also includes some optional features, such as improved graphics for the title screen[^1^], adjustable difficulty levels, and customizable controls.
