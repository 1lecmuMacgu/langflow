You can download and install it on your computer as an offline installer, which means you don't need an internet connection to use it. However, you need to have a 64-bit operating system to run this version of Adobe Premiere Pro. One of the features that makes Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018 stand out is its Adobe Mercury Playback Engine, which uses the power of your graphics card (GPU) to speed up the video processing and rendering.
